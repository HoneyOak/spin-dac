## 2025-07-25 Research (3 hours)
I found out that existing commmercial solutions are expensive, and there aren't many existing projects that implement a compact, budget DAC. There are plenty guides, though. I found a few from which I can get an idea of the BOM and feasability, as well as the rough circuit diagram.
This shouldn't be extremely difficult to pull off. Sure, I would have to maintain a clean circuit and prevent noise. But the circuit itself has 3 major components: USB to I2S, DAC, and OP-amp (and I'm adding a potentiometer for analog volume control).
Existing projects gave me lots of confidence though (some even handwired!): https://orronoco.blogspot.com/2022/01/build-your-own-portable-usb-dac.html, https://summivox.wordpress.com/2016/12/14/making-myself-a-usb-dac-headphone-amp-part-1/
That said, I have never made a 4-layer PCB before (or really, never made a pcb at all yet). So this would be a fun challenge!
