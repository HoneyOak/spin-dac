# Spin DAC
A Digital-Analog converter is used for... well, exactly that. Particularly, I wanna make a better DAC that converts digital music signals into analog signals for headphones/speakers. Commercial options are quite expensive and big. It is, however, (theoretically) possible to build a high quality, compact DAC.

This project features a compact, yet high-quality, USB-C DAC, with an inbuilt op-amp.

# Features
- upto 24 bit 192kHz audio
