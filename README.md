# Spin DAC
A Digital-Analog Converter (DAC) is used for... well, exactly that. Particularly, I want to make a high-quality DAC that converts digital music signals into analog signals for headphones/speakers. Commercial options are quite expensive and big. It is, however, (theoretically) possible to build a budget portable DAC.

This project features a compact, yet high-quality, USB-C DAC, with an inbuilt op-amp. With this, we can acheive significantly better sound quality, with extremely low noise, on any usb-c device.

# Features
- upto 24 bit 192kHz audio
- Ultra Low Noise
- Seperated Analog and Digital Signals on PCB
- 4 layer PCB to avoid noise and EMI
